Hi! My name is Ted Neben and I am a Software Engineer looking to make an impact in my field and make a name for myself. My drive is met with my passion for people and only limited by my work ethic, that knows no bounds. Connecting with others and finding purpose among each other lifts me to higher standards that, in the long run, lead to better endeavours for everyone around. My goal and objective with every new opportunity is to connect, create, and drive forward any and all plans to ensure growth for everyone. Having owned and operated 2 businesses, as well as having been a Freelance Photographer and Videographer, has given me experience that most miss out on. Having leadership qualities not only allows me to see from the helm, but it aso allows me to see where things can be improved upon as well. However, every great mind starts out by being humble, and there is nothing short of that here. I want to be able to learn from my mistakes, my success, and my thought process to give my work the best chance of being at its top performance. I have led several people, in-person and online, to meet day to day operations while continuing to grow as an individual. Ultimately, I am human. Someone who understands that mistakes exist in this world, but someone who also understands that greatness is sought after the first fall. I enjoy meeting challenges head on and not only learning how to approach that particular case, but how to learn from it and help approach everything else I come across as well.
